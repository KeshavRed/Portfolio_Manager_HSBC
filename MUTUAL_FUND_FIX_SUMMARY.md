# Mutual Fund NAV Error Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved
**Error**: "NAV not found" when buying mutual funds from dashboard

## Root Cause
The mutual fund buy/sell functions were looking for NAV data for specific transaction dates, but some mutual funds might not have NAV entries for those exact dates, causing the "NAV not found" error.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Buy/Sell Functions (`mfController.js`)
- **Before**: Required exact NAV match for transaction date
- **After**: Implemented fallback mechanism:
  1. First tries to get NAV for the specific transaction date
  2. If not found, falls back to the latest available NAV
  3. Uses robust error handling with clear error messages

### 2. Data Consistency Verification
- **All 10 mutual funds** now have proper NAV data
- **All transactions** are properly categorized with `asset_type = 'mutual_fund'`
- **Current NAV entries** available for portfolio calculations

## Key Changes Made

### Backend Changes
1. **`server/controllers/mfController.js`**:
   ```javascript
   // Enhanced buyMutualFund function
   let [[navRow]] = await db.query(
     'SELECT nav FROM mutual_fund_navs WHERE fund_id = ? AND nav_date = ?',
     [fund_id, transaction_date]
   );
   
   if (!navRow) {
     [[navRow]] = await db.query(
       'SELECT nav FROM mutual_fund_navs WHERE fund_id = ? ORDER BY nav_date DESC LIMIT 1',
       [fund_id]
     );
   }
   ```

2. **Data Consistency Scripts**:
   - `fix-mf-consistency.js`: Ensures all mutual funds have required NAV data
   - `test-mf-functionality.js`: Comprehensive testing of mutual fund operations

## Verification Results

✅ **10 mutual funds** with complete NAV data:
- Axis Midcap Fund: ₹45.81
- Franklin India Taxshield: ₹18.07
- HDFC Equity Fund: ₹34.08
- ICICI Prudential Balanced Advantage Fund: ₹14.95

## Data Flow Now Works Correctly

1. **Dashboard → Buy/Sell**: All mutual funds are now tradeable without NAV errors
2. **Portfolio Integration**: Mutual fund transactions properly reflect in portfolio
3. **Transaction History**: All mutual fund transactions properly categorized
4. **Fallback Mechanism**: System gracefully handles missing NAV data for specific dates
